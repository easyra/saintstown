      <p class='beginning'>Yah has a way of painting a picture long before we discover we are the masterpieces. I always speak of myself as pieces of a puzzle trying to figure out how each piece fits. I wrote this poem 29 years ago before I had a son that I would name Alimayu, before I would have locks and before desiring a wife. This poem is just one that I wrote many years ago that resonates today.</p>

            <p>
            The wind spoke in subtle whispers, its breath causing the tall blades of grass to lean to one side.  The birds glide over the field in complete security no harm comes to those who roam in this place.  The center of the field stands a large oak, its branches extending into the stratosphere.  Alimayu leans gently against the tree, his lean dark muscular frame resting against its trunk.  He wipes the perspiration from his forehead and regains control of his breathing.  He would run almost six miles to get to this place.  Removing the oversized “Rasta” cap form his head, a waterfall of dark brown godly dreadlocks tumble onto his face.  Moving the hair form his eyes, he turns to face his childhood companion.
        </p>
        <p>“It’s been a long time old friend,” he says.  Alimayu hands slowly rubbing the jagged bark, “It felt as though I needed to see you before I returned to school for I am not coming back.  It’s time for me to receive my calling in the world.</p>
        <p>Alimayu sits on one of the tree’s protruding roots trying to understand the spirits churning within his soul.  His hands begin to move across his face.  He feels the rounded Solomon thickness of his lips, the unyielding width of his Moses nose, and the soft kinky lamp texture of his Yahsua hair.  Was the world ready for such a blunt example of El?</p>
        <p>He gazes into the turquoise colored sky, watching the ivory clouds drift towards the horizon.  Things always seemed to be alive in this field.  The colors were bright and filled with energy that exploded into the air, making breathing more of an adventure than a necessity.  In the real world everything was distant, cold...white.  Color was not a thing of joy or power, it was a curse.  Alimayu felt cursed.</p>
        <p>“How can I expect to survive in a world where I’m viewed as some sort of inferior creature?  Where my very existence is associated with criminal statistics, and my might submerged in white sex fantasies,” Alimayu looks into the heavens for answers there is a timely reply.</p>
        <p>His mind begins to drift off, slowly toward the past.  Alimayu’s mother, kneeling in the exact place where he sits, looking into the clouds, tonguing with Yah and his father sat on the protruding root writing for hours and hours.  The tree seems to connect the ground he sits on to the universe.  The tree’s limbs wrapping around the sun grasping Alimayu in an eternal hug, coupling the earth with the cosmos.  Alimayu’s father would ponder such spiritual ideas.  He made even the most cryptic images sound so beautifully real.  “We are of the universe.  The stars, sun and earth float within our dark boundaries.  We are children of the sun.  Her energy drawn to our Blackness, we are children of the Most High.  All things live because we live.”</p>
        <p>“What does this have to do with my disturbance?  How can any of this help a Black man living in a racist world?”  Alimayu is baffle.  His father’s ideas had always confused him as child, so why were they coming to haunt him at this moment?</p>
        <p>Earth</p>
        <p>An unfamiliar spirit began to move within Alimayu’s soul.  Looking down at the ground beneath him, Alimayu began to slowly pluck away the blades of the green grass.  With each detaching his spine began to straighten, his senses became more alert.  In time he created a large patch of fertile soil.  Plunging both hands into the ground, he felt warmth shoot through his veins, making him stronger.  He stared at the substance in complete amazement.  “We are one,” he realizes, observing the color of the earth is the same as that of his skin.</p>
        <p>He brings the soil to his face.  He smells it.  The sweet scent takes his soul back to times and places he never knew.</p>
        <p>Strong black spirits, levitating large stones across an Egyptian desert and women, dark as coal dancing around a fire, its flames rise and fall with each tribal chant, warriors fighting against decadent hands to maintain their life force.  Freedom ships loads of people’s arms, legs, and souls in shackles, strong black spirits working as slaves on a plantation their pain creating the “amazing grace” and “weepin willow,” a new kind of spirit.</p>
        <p>Alimayu pauses for a brief second, noticing the change taking place within his soul.  Its rhythms begin to coincide with that of the earth and the wind, creating beautifully complex musical vibration that would make even Coltrane enviable.</p>
        <p>He looks at his soiled hands and begins to rub the earth’s remains into his dreaded crown.  His soul throbs with the funky tempo of his black spirit.  He then walks into the Yah’s world, a husband.</p>
